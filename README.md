### Why:question:
I get some questions by email (mrm8488@gmail.com), my [personal website](https://mrm8488.github.io/#contact), Reddit and so on. But **this way anyone can read the answer!** :eyes:

Anything means *anything*. Professional and Personal. I could give you some advices specially (because I've more experience) in the following fields:

- Node.js (Express, CLI tools, etc.)
- MongoDB (schema modeling and so on)
- Data Science (Machine Learning, Neural Networks, etc.)
- SCRUM
- SOA/Microservices
- How to architect the software to build your bussines idea

### Guidelines

 - :mag: Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
 - :memo: Use a succinct title and description.
 - :bug: Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
 - :signal_strength: Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
 - :blush: Be nice, civil and polite.
 - :heart_eyes: If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback will
   probably come faster.
